# Old school runescape object detection model

A model trained with Tensorflows object detection API to detect ores in oldschool runescape.

Faster_rcnn_resnet50_v1_640x640 from Tensorflows object detection ZOO was the pretrained model used in training.

    -Images folder contains folders for training and testing images with corresponding xml annotations.
    
    -Pictures folder contains screenshots of the model working real time.

    -Training folder contains generated .tfrecord files and labelmap.pbtxt for the detections
